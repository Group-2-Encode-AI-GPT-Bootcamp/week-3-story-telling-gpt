# AI Interactions for Story Telling App

# Josh's Interaction
## Setup
- Used text-generation-webui with OpenAI API enabled
- Tested two models:
  1. [Llama 3.1 Storm 8B](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=llama+3.1+storm+8b&atb=v314-1&ia=web)
  2. [TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0](https://huggingface.co/TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0)

## Process
1. Created three characters:
   - Jorgan: Swedish guy with a very strong accent, loves making new friends
   - Josh: Old WWII vet suffering from PTSD, doesn't like parties
   - Pepe the pig: Adorable pig who loves food

2. Selected story options:
   - Genre: Sci fi
   - Tone: Happy

3. Generated stories using both models
   - Results for Llama 3.1 Storm 8B: [interaction1.png](interaction1.png)
   - Results for TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0: [interaction2.png](interaction2.png)

## Observations
- Both models generated unique stories that fit the tone and the genre. They were completely unique and creative stories, much better than the kinds of output I've gotten with ChatGPT>
